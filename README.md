## Introduction
Hi, my name is Vedant Pol. 
Welcome to my website!

My journey with open source began during my college days when I discovered Linux. 
Since then, I have been actively involved in various open source projects, fixing bugs, contributing code, 
and helping others in the community. I believe that by working together, developers can create software 
that is more reliable, secure, and innovative.

Thus I developed a portfolio website designed to resemble a Linux terminal, which serves as a 
platform for showcasing my skills and expressing my passion for Linux.
